# hello-world

Hi Humans!

Kongfuhuanghuang here, I like Java, Android and other languages like C/C++, Ruby, Python, wed development, Javascript and etc.
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to Earth tacos.

But seriously, I am using this as a means to build up my experience. I hope to be able to use this as a way to build up my programmers resume. I have chosen programming as my livelyhood. So here I go!
